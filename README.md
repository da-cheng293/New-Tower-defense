# New-Tower-defense
Fight on is a 2.5D tower defense game that incorporates some features of minesweeper. There are three different turrets to choose, different turrets can cause different degrees of damage to the virus as well as the construction cost. The turrets could only be placed in flipped squares with numbers or with mines that have been speculated. The players should flip as many squares as possible without mine and correctly speculate the place with mine based on the mechanics of minesweepers to increase their fighting power and win the game.
